# SULI-Winter2023: Optimizing Atomic Layer Deposition using a Hybrid of Machine Learning Methods

## Overview
This repository contains additional code and resources for the project "Optimizing Atomic Layer Deposition using a Hybrid of Machine Learning Methods" by Anthony DiBenedetto, Angel Yanguas-Gil, Jeffrey W. Elam, and Osama "Sam" Abuomar. The study uses machine learning to assess the quality of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) processes, focusing on predicting the standard deviations of film thickness as an indicator of quality.

## Introduction
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a thin film growth technique used extensively in semiconductor manufacturing and other applications. This study evaluates machine learning methods to determine the quality of ALD processes, using a synthetic dataset to simulate various ALD scenarios. The goal is to classify ALD processes as ideal or non-ideal using minimal experiments, thus accelerating ALD process development.

## Additional Code and Resources
This repository contains additional code that complements the main repository found at [SURE-Summer2023 repository](https://github.com/adibenedetto117/SURE-Summer2023). The research was extended between two appointments, and this repository includes:
- Dimensionality analysis
- Nearest neighbor classification
- Neural network training and evaluation
- Random forest implementation
- Support vector machine implementation

## Acknowledgments
This research is supported by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) funding from Argonne National Laboratory and the SURE program at Lewis University.
